### Features:

- to run synchronous functions as asynchronous, the decorator `@set_async` is used
- to set the timer for the execution of an asynchronous function, the decorator `@coro_timer('seconds:int')` is used, as
  a parameter takes time in seconds
- to create your own keyboards, `BaseKeyboardBuilder` is used, namely the classes inherited from it
  `BaseReplyKeyboardBuilder` and `BaseInlineKeyboardBuilder`
- in `BaseReplyKeyboardBuilder` it is possible to add buttons with the validator `BaseButtonValidator`, based on the
  builder will be
  make a decision about adding or not adding a button to the keyboard
- It is possible to use the modified aiogram storage `MemoryStorage` - `ModifiedMemoryStorage`
    - the point is that redis in **pooling** mode does not have time to save data to storage, which is why some of the
      data may get lost.
    - MemoryStorage does not have such a problem, but at the same time it is impossible to save even the FSM state in
      MemoryStorage.
    - ModifiedMemoryStorage allows you to store states in SQL, in a separate states table - and load them pre
      reboot the bot. However, the storage data will still be lost on reboot. However, such a way out is still
      better than the possible loss of data when saving to redis.
    - **BUT**: in the bot launch mode via webhook, this problem with redis is irrelevant.
